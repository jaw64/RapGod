s
president
obama called for congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the united states a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal
he proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured to cap premium increases and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs
his proposal was to spend 900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan also known as the public option to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care
it would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre existing conditions and require every american to carry health coverage
the plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans
on july 14 2009 house democratic leaders introduced a 1 017 page plan for overhauling the u
s
health care system which obama wanted congress to approve by the end of 2009

on march 21 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act aca passed by the senate in december was passed in the house by a vote of 219 to 212
obama signed the bill into law on march 23 2010
the aca includes health related provisions most of which took effect in 2014 including expanding medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 of the federal poverty level fpl starting in 2014 subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 of the fpl 88 000 for family of four in 2010 so their maximum out of pocket payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9
5 of income providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre existing conditions establishing health insurance exchanges prohibiting annual coverage caps and support for medical research
according to white house and congressional budget office figures the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level
the costs of these provisions are offset by taxes fees and cost saving measures such as new medicare taxes for those in high income brackets taxes on indoor tanning cuts to the medicare advantage program in favor of traditional medicare and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons
in march 2010 the congressional budget office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by 143 billion over the first decade
the law faced several legal challenges primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional
on june 28 2012 the supreme court ruled by a 5 4 vote in national federation of independent business v
sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the u
s
congress's taxing authority
in burwell v
hobby lobby the court ruled that closely held for profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the religious freedom restoration act from regulations adopted under the aca that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives
in june 2015 the court ruled 6 3 in king v
burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges not only those purchasing plans established by the state as the statute reads
