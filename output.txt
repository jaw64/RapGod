the office is an american television comedy series that aired on nbc from march 24 2005 to may 16 2013
it is an adaptation of the bbc series of the same name
the office was adapted for american audiences by greg daniels a veteran writer for saturday night live king of the hill and the simpsons
it is co produced by daniels deedle dee productions and reveille productions later shine america in association with universal television
the original executive producers were greg daniels howard klein ben silverman ricky gervais and stephen merchant with numerous others being promoted in later seasons
the series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the scranton pennsylvania branch of the fictional dunder mifflin paper company
to simulate the look of an actual documentary it is filmed in a single camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track
the show debuted on nbc as a mid season replacement and ran for nine seasons and 201 episodes
the office features steve carell rainn wilson john krasinski jenna fischer b

novak ed helms and james spader on the main cast
the first season of the office was met with mixed reviews but the following four seasons received widespread acclaim from television critics
these seasons were included on several critics year end top tv series lists winning several awards including four primetime emmy awards including outstanding comedy series in 2006
while later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended the show's run with a positive reception
greg daniels served as the senior series showrunner for the first four seasons of the series and developed the british series for american television
he then left the position when he co created the comedy series parks and recreation with fellow office writer michael schur and divided his time between the two series
paul lieberstein and jennifer celotta were named the series showrunners for the fifth season
celotta left the series after the sixth season and lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons
he left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential dwight schrute spin off the farm which was eventually passed up by nbc
daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season
other executive producers include cast members b

novak and mindy kaling
kaling novak daniels lieberstein and schur made up the original team of writers
kaling novak and lieberstein also serve multiple roles on the series as they play regular characters on the show as well as write direct and produce episodes
credited with twenty four episodes kaling is the most prolific writer on the staff
ricky gervais and stephen merchant who created the original british series are credited as executive producers and wrote the pilot and the third season episode the convict 
merchant later directed the episode customer survey while gervais appeared in the episodes the seminar and search committee 
randall einhorn is the most frequent director of the series with 15 credited episodes
the series has also had several guest directors including lost co creator j
j
abrams buffy the vampire slayer creator joss whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers jon favreau harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb
episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner
before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices
this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation
the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version
daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation
he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode
after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day 
following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable
they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities
they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version
a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular 22 minute time slot leading to several cuts
for example the script for the episode search committee was initially 75 pages 10 pages too long
a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process
fischer said our shows are 100 percent scripted
they put everything down on paper
but we get to play around a little bit too
steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers
this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by daniels
deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage
in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbc
com and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes
daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure
according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script
the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for
nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined
martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part
in january 2004 variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role
at the time he was already committed to another nbc mid season replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office
carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned
he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations
other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f
tompkins
rainn wilson was cast as power hungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned
wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him
seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role
john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests
krasinski had attended school with b
j
novak and the two were friends
fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle
in an interview on npr's fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry
when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim
adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam
the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman
kinsey had originally auditioned for pam
the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won
flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinson gould before landing the role of meredith palmer
baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin
ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis
at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford
while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february 2007 nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular
four of the show's writers have also performed in front of the camera

j
novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his stand up act
paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novak's suggestion after his cold readings of scripts
greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling on screen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode diversity day where michael needed to be slapped by a minority
since that slap i've been on the show as kelly kapoor says kaling
michael schur has also made occasional appearances as dwight's cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr
brown
plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts
the office was filmed with a single camera setup in a cin ma v rit allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across
the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock
the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming
the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation
the main action of the show is supplemented with talking head interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the day's events
in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary
according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly
the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format
for example in the fourth season episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley
the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene
despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedy style of the series
this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans
the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones
it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members
some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song
starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence
the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski
the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices
however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton e mail surveillance 
featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michael's attempt to seem hip by using mambo no
5 and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone
daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as it already appeared in the episode
the office employs an ensemble cast
many characters portrayed by the office cast are based on the british version of the show
while these characters normally have the same attitude and perceptions as their british counterparts the roles have been redesigned to better fit the american show
the show is known for its generally large cast size with many of its actors and actresses known particularly for their improvisational work
steve carell stars as michael scott regional manager of the dunder mifflin scranton branch
loosely based on david brent gervais character in the british version scott is a well intentioned man whose attempts at humor while seemingly innocent to himself often offends and annoys his peers and employees and in some situations lead to reprimanding from his superiors
rainn wilson portrays dwight schrute who based upon gareth keenan is a salesman and the assistant to the regional manager a fictional title created by michael
john krasinski portrays jim halpert a salesman and in later seasons co manager who is often known for his wittiness and his hijinks on schrute often accompanied by pam beesly 
halpert is based upon tim canterbury and is known to have feelings for pam the receptionist
pam played by jenna fischer is based on dawn tinsley
she is shy but in many cases a cohort with jim in his pranks on dwight

novak portrays ryan howard who for the first two seasons is a temporary worker but is promoted to sales representative in the third season
he later ascends to the position of vice president north east region and director of new media until his treachery was exposed for corporate fraud and he was fired
after this he gets a job in a bowling alley and then briefly works for the michael scott paper company
after all this and a stint in rehab he eventually ends up again as the temporary worker at the scranton branch
the accounting department features angela martin an admitted uptight and often hypocritical christian who wishes to keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible kevin malone a lovable but dim witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and m ms and oscar martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for michael's unintentional off color comments

before the show aired ricky gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers
the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short lived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version
the new york daily news called it so diluted there's little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a miles better bbc original
a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard 
maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchant's script he'll come into his own
but right now he's a pale imitation
tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out
the second season was better received
james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions 
with a tone that's more satiric and less mordant

the new boss is different from the old boss and that's fine by me
he named it the second best tv show of 2006 after battlestar galactica
entertainment weekly writer mark harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating thanks to the fearless steve carell an ever stronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible it honors ricky gervais original and works on its own terms
the a
v
club reviewer nathan rabin expressed its views on the show's progression after a rocky start the office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of tv's funniest sharpest shows
the casting of steve carell in the gervais role proved to be a masterstroke
the american office is that rarest of anomalies a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity
the series has been included on several top tv series lists
the show placed 61 on entertainment weekly's new tv classics list

while paste named it the sixth best sitcom of 2010
in 2013 the writers guild of america placed it at 66 on their list of 101 best written tv series
the show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior
john spector ceo of the conference board says that both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad
dilbert creator scott adams also touts the similarities the lesson from the office and from dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it
a labor affiliated group praised the episode boys and girls for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on american television

however it denoted that all four of them received generally favorable reviews from critics awarding a 61 85 78 and 64 score out of 100 to each of them respectively
it later named it the thirteenth most mentioned series on best of decade top ten lists
the last few seasons were criticized for a dip in quality
the sixth season received criticisms for a lack of stakes for the characters
other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the jim and pam romance
the office co creator ricky gervais wrote in his blog referring to search committee particularly warren buffett's guest appearance if you're going to jump a shark jump a big one
and compared the episode to the chris martin episode of gervais's other series extras
he later said i fucking didn't diss the office that's for sure 
some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of steve carell
rainn wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes creatively such as the chemistry between spader and helms which he called a bit dark and argued that the show should have gone for a brighter and more energized relationship
despite this there are later series episodes that have received critical acclaim including stress relief niagara garage sale goodbye michael dwight christmas a
